<h3>About me</h3>
<p>My name is Nikita, and I am a beginner Frontend Developer. I really want to find a job and dedicate myself fully to the work I love. I strive to master the skills necessary to become a professional in my field. To achieve my goals and enjoy what I do, I actively follow the IT world, its development, and new technologies that I can use in my pet projects and future job. I enjoy learning and constantly exploring something new, because in doing so, I not only study the technologies necessary for my work, but also grow as a person. New knowledge broadens my horizons, makes me wiser, and helps me become a more experienced developer. Thanks to knowledge, life becomes easier. My love for the IT world began in childhood. I loved spending time playing video games, but I didn’t just play them. I was always curious about how programs are created, how a computer works, and how people create instructions for computers so that we can “talk” with them and understand each other. I was also interested in learning how a computer works on a physical level (what components it consists of, what they are for, and how they work), as well as how developers create programs, websites, applications, and games that we use so often that computers and even mobile devices have gradually become an indispensable part of every person’s life. By the way, I am studying at a university called Moscow Polytechnic. My major is “Control in Technical Systems.” In my classes, I learn not only about the structure of a computer, but also about microprocessor technology in general. This knowledge helps me better understand how to optimize the websites and web applications I develop. Why websites and web applications? Let me explain. At the beginning of 2025, I started studying on the Yandex Practicum platform in the Frontend Development track. I didn’t choose this path by chance. I love the IT world and I want to achieve great heights in my field. What will help me get there is my passion for this craft, which I express through a creative approach to solving development tasks. It is exactly this—my love for what I do, my desire to express it, my drive to constantly learn new skills, gain knowledge, and apply it to reach new heights—that helped me choose my path of growth in the vast world of IT. That is why I want to, and can confidently, call myself a beginner Frontend specialist.</p>
